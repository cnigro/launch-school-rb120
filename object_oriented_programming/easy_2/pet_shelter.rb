# a cat named Pudding
# a bearded dragon named Darwin

# B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
# a dog named Molly
# a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
# a dog named Kennedy
# a fish named Chester

# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.

# The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented.
